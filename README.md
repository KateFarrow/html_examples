# Thet Static Website examples
This repo is a small collection of static sites to be used as a development tool. 

There are a coolection of websites that has only the basic information set up in them, and it is the job of the trainee/junior developer to complete the site. There is a .png file of what the site should look like. I suggest that you use a chome extension called Perfect Pixel to match your site against the design. I will also be setting up a series of wraith tests to compare the site with a finial finished version at different screen resolutions. 

This will be a working in progress project, but it is something that i hope to be able to expand on and develop to help new developers test their skills against a more practical project.

The Initial goal is to develop HTML and CSS skills.
This is the foundation of web development. From here it would be great to add on complexity with JavaScript, Node, React, Redux and maybe from Drupal. The idea being we take these examples created here and create a full webiste using Drupal or a MERN stack technology.  

I will continue to update this readme with tools and references to learning materials as I discover them and as they become relevant to the projects being built.
