# Brief
The Coming soon website, is a placeholder site for a new product we are about to 
launch. We need a responsive websites with a "coming soon" message in the center 
of the page and countdown date under this. 

In the top left of the page we need the company name. This might change to a 
logo image later on, but we are waiting for the design for this, so in the mean 
time please just add some text here.

There needs to be a footer in the bottom left corner with a link back to the 
design.
